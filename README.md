# World_Weather_Analysis

## Module 6 Challenge

The purpose of this exercise was to leverage multiple Python functions to 
- generate random latitude and longitude coordinates
- use the citipy module to identify the cities closest to the random latitude and longitude coordinates
- retrieve weather data for each city via an OpenWeatherMap.org API call
- use the Google Maps plugin to locate the closest hotel to our preferred cities
- use the Google Directions API to plan a four-stop trip between four of the previously identified hotels
